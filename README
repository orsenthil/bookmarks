Introduction
============
**Bookmarks** is a simple personal web-based application to manage web bookmarks.

It was coded as a funny practice, but it includes some nice features:

- advanced search
- tags cloud
- years cloud

It's written in `Python 3`_ and uses `BottlePy`_ web microframework
and `jQuery`_ javascript library. Both are included with the package.

I think this little application can be useful for anyone learning
Python web programming.

Download from `here`_.
Code and development is publically available in the `BitBucket repository`_.

**Bookmarks** has impletented a powerful searching mechanism, which is
